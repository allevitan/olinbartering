base.html :This is the top-level template - with few exceptions, every template extends this.

my_bulletins.html: This is a for listing the currently logged in user's bulletins (that they created and replied to? we should figure this out - we'll need a new many-to-many field in Bulletin to store that info)

Open questions:

Should we include filtering in my_bulletins? i.e., bulletins I created, bulletins I've replied to, etc?

If we're already filtering the home view, we might as well apply it to my_bulletins (or at least provide the options.)

Does this setup work?  Works with me.  

Should we allow users to access the profiles of others to see what they have to offer / would like?
